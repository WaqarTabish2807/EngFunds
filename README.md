# Problem Statement 

One of the main issues with many organisations is the lack of transparency about the utilization of funding. We frequently hear about charity that end up being frauds. Users will be able to track money as well as understand how funds are being used by creating an on-chain charity organization.

## The EngPay basics
###How do I start a EngPay?
Just tap the green button on our Dapp and connect to your wallet. Then, write your story, set your fundraising goal (which you can lower or raise at any time), and share it out.

### What should I Brief about?
People want to know two things: The purpose of your fundraising and how their contribution will be used. You can add a photo or video to further illustrate your point.

### Are there any fees?
Nand. Everything else goes directly to your cause.
But there is an option available during registration to support our cause.
